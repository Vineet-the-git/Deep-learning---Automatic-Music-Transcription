# Deep-learning-Automatic-Music-Transcription
This repository contains the research done and the codes written for the semester project - Automatic Music Transcription, offered by Electronics Club IIT Kanpur.
1. We have explored various models, for example, CNN, RNN and models with the combination of two, with a sole motive of achieveing maximum accuracy. 
2. For preprocessing of the music files, we have tried various ways, for example, `constant Q- transform`, `Short- time fourier transform`, and `mel-frequency spectrum`, and have compared the results with respect to the model used. 
3. Each folder in this repository represents a different model trained for automatic music transcription. 
4. We will keep on updating the repository until we arrive at the end dates of the projects.  

Till then, stay tuned.
